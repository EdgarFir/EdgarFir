## Hi there, I'm **Edgar Firmino** 👋

I love spending time with my family, playing football, and programming.  
For 10 years, I worked as a store and warehouse operator, and during that time I discovered programming — a moment that truly changed my life.  
After completing two online courses in **Computer Science** and **Python**, I realized this was the path I wanted to follow.

I’m currently strengthening my foundations as a **Computer Science student at 42 Porto**, a peer-to-peer, project-based school that helps develop technical, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills.
